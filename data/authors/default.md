Cyber security enthusiast, Software engineer, Social engineer, Automotive Electrian, Cultivator, Hydroponics grow, Amateur Glass blower.

Stoner and psychonaut.

Traveler, I Love to get lost in different countries.

Athlete. Marathon runner, triathelete, hiker and climber.

There’s a lot to me, get to know me.
I’ve lived a rollercoaster of a life for such a young age.

I dislike superficial people and people consumed by mainstream media. If you’re a Disney child or anything of that nature please ignore me.

I live a different reality to most people. I don’t live the norm.
