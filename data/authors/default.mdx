# I am <span className='text-secondaryAccent dark:text-secondaryAccentDark'>SinfulHymn</span>

My path into tech started when I was twelve and got phished on RuneScape. That moment didn’t just frustrate me. It sparked an obsession with how systems work, how people interact with them, and how information can be manipulated. That curiosity pulled me into cybersecurity, programming and eventually social engineering. I didn’t just learn to code. I learned to read people, think like an attacker and understand how trust is built and broken online.

Over time I’ve worn many hats. I spent years as an automotive technician focused on electrical diagnostics and complex repairs. I worked in STEM education, teaching middle school students robotics, JavaScript and 3D modeling with Fusion 360, turning abstract concepts into something tangible for young minds. I held internships as a backend web developer, building APIs, writing SQL and working in agile teams with real production workflows and mentorship.

I’ve also become skilled at analyzing systems beyond code—studying how people behave, what motivates them and how trust functions in both digital and real environments. That mindset has served me in technical roles, leadership, teaching and creative work.

At my core I’m a builder and a systems thinker. I reverse engineer, I teach, I learn fast and I don’t shy away from complexity. This site is one slice of everything I’ve lived, translated into code, words and stories.
